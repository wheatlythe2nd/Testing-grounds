# password-prompt-app
This is Wheatly's first time programing. They're going to have different programs here, and they will be using this repo as a learning and development tool.



----password-prompt.py----
  This program is designed using assistance from copilot to fetch a user made password, encrypt and store the hash, and then parse the user for the password to identify if they input the same password.
